== Solution Strategy



****
In this block we will talk about fundamental decisions as well as the architecture that shapes our system.


Let's highlight four fundamental decisions.
****

****
**Technological decisions:**

We have decided to use Javascript because we have been inspired by the solid-chess project and it is the language that it uses.
****

****
**Decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system:**

A functional decomposition is used, in such a way that the modules are separated by their functionality.
****

****

**Decisions on the key quality objectives:**

In order to reach the goal of security, a login is included and to make it usable, tests have been done with the final product with people who do not belong to the project.
****

****
**Relevant organizational decisions:**

At this moment there is only one developer, so there are no relevant organization decisions.
