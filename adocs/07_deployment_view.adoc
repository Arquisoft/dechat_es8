This section deals with the technical infrastructure of our system, as well as its basic components.

First of all comment that we are set to work with SOLID as the basis of the project.

=== Things to keep in mind

****
The user must be logged in to be able to interact with the chat itself.

The conversation will be saved in the public directory to prevent a user from having a private directory. This should be improved in the face of other more advanced versions so that nobody who is not authorized can access such conversations.


The messages that a person sends are stored in their own POD. To access the messages sent by the other interlocutor, the application searches the POD of the other person, who will have a chat with the person who is using the application. This allows you to follow the SOLID database because if someone wants to delete their own messages, they can do so.
