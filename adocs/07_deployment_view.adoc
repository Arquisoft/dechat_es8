This section deals with the technical infrastructure of our system, as well as its basic components.

First of all comment that we are set to work with SOLID as the basis of the project.

Starting from this base, it was decided to make a web application in javascript since it seemed the best way to approach the project.
This is because we already knew the language and had several resources of support.

As for the web server in case you have cloned the repository locally, you can execute the http-server command that will provide some ip addresses to execute the application.
